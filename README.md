# Stacks Vault Smart Contract

## Overview

Stacks Vault is a sophisticated decentralized vault smart contract designed for secure token management, deposits, withdrawals, and yield generation across multiple protocols on the Stacks blockchain.

## Features

### Key Functionalities

- User token deposits with flexible limits
- Withdrawals with balance tracking
- Reward calculation and claiming
- Multi-protocol yield strategy management
- Token whitelisting
- Emergency shutdown mechanism
- Platform fee management

### Security Measures

- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling
- Token validation
- Deposit and withdrawal limits
- Protocol and strategy management

## Contract Specifications

### Supported Tokens

- Implements SIP-010 token trait
- Tokens must be whitelisted by contract owner
- Supports multiple token types

### Deposit Characteristics

- Minimum deposit: 100,000 sats
- Maximum deposit: 1,000,000,000 sats
- Total Value Locked (TVL) tracking
- Deposit block height recording

### Reward Mechanism

- Yield calculated based on:
  - User deposit amount
  - Protocol APY
  - Time (block-based)
  - Protocol allocation strategy

### Protocol Management

- Maximum of 100 protocols
- APY range: 0% - 100%
- Individual protocol activation/deactivation
- Allocation-based rebalancing

## Error Handling

### Error Codes

- `u1000`: Not authorized
- `u1001`: Invalid amount
- `u1002`: Insufficient balance
- `u1003`: Protocol not whitelisted
- `u1004`: Strategy disabled
- `u1005`: Maximum deposit reached
- `u1006`: Minimum deposit not met
- `u1007`: Invalid protocol ID
- `u1008`: Protocol already exists
- `u1009`: Invalid APY
- `u1010`: Invalid name
- `u1011`: Invalid token
- `u1012`: Token not whitelisted

## Key Functions

### User Functions

- `deposit`: Add tokens to the vault
- `withdraw`: Remove tokens from the vault
- `claim-rewards`: Collect accumulated rewards

### Admin Functions

- `add-protocol`: Register new yield protocols
- `update-protocol-status`: Enable/disable protocols
- `update-protocol-apy`: Adjust protocol yields
- `set-platform-fee`: Modify fee structure
- `set-emergency-shutdown`: Pause vault operations
- `whitelist-token`: Approve new tokens

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Deposit tokens
(contract-call? stacks-vault deposit token-trait amount)

;; Withdraw tokens
(contract-call? stacks-vault withdraw token-trait amount)

;; Claim rewards
(contract-call? stacks-vault claim-rewards token-trait)
```

## Security Considerations

- Only contract owner can manage protocols and settings
- Emergency shutdown available
- Strict token and protocol validation
- Rewards calculated with precision

## Performance Notes

- Uses map-based storage for efficient data management
- Block-height based reward calculation
- Supports up to 5 concurrent protocols
- Platform fee adjustable (max 10%)

## Dependencies

- Requires tokens implementing SIP-010 trait
- Compatible with Stacks blockchain

## Limitations

- Maximum 100 protocol IDs
- APY capped at 100%
- Requires manual protocol and token whitelisting
